# File Metadata Microservice

This project is a File Metadata Microservice, created as part of FreeCodeCamp's APIs and Microservices certification. It replicates the functionality of FreeCodeCamp's working demo by implementing a backend for handling file uploads and extracting metadata.

## Project Overview

1. **Form Submission:** The microservice allows users to submit a form that includes a file upload.

2. **File Input Field Naming:** The form's file input field is named "upfile," following the specified requirement.

3. **JSON Response:** Upon submitting a file, the microservice returns a JSON response containing the file name, type, and size in bytes.
